Dr. Murphy is the Founder of Under Par Analytics. Prior to starting this company TJ worked for over 30 years as a biomedical research scientist and teacher. That work involved using sophisticated statistical methods to wrangle insights from complex biological data sets. Then communicating those results to diverse audiences. TJ taught statistics for over a decade to more than 500 biomedical PhD students. He launched the internet startup Gradschoolmatch in 2013, which was acquired by ETS in 2020. When not exploring data, TJ enjoys golfing and zipping around Atlanta on his ebike.
